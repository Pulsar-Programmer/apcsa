Visual Sort

For each of the 3 Quadratic sorts (selection, insertion and bubble), create a
visual demonstration of the sort being applied to a screen of some custom
items called Piece. The Piece will have properties that can be used to sort.
The Pieces being switched (or moved) should “highlight” and then swap to
show the user each iteration of the sort. Be creative with how they
“highlight” and how you demonstrate the swap. The user should input how
many Pieces, what kind of sort to use and whether they will initially be
arranged randomly or in reverse order. Put a delay before the process starts.
-All sorts should be in their individual methods, along with redrawing of the
panel. Keep track of all the array accessors and modifiers in the middle
of the sort and communicate that at the end of the sort.
Don’t forget about the title of the Table, you can write things there too.
-Call the driver class “SortDriver” and the Piece class “Piece” and the Table
class “Table”. Note the capital letters, the Table will have the array of Pieces.
-Be creative with the piece and how you sort it, but makes sure it’s clear.
-Make sure you don’t’ create a new frame after every run through but instead
just reset the original frame.
