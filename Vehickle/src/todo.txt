

static variable activeCars that keeps track of how many ACTIVE
cars (including all the sub classes) that are currently driving and totalCars that
keeps track TOTAL cars that have ever existed.
Note: A Vehicle becomes inactive after it reaches 200K miles.







getValue():
- Truck: The base price of the car but it depreciates at 5% for every 10K miles
cumulatively. So not 10% for 20K miles but 5% for the first 10K and then
another 5% for the next 10K.

The Truck class should also have the ability to tow (tow(Vehicle other)) other
Vehicles but not other Trucks.
Certain Vehicles which are towed, can have scrap value even if they’re totaled
(condition = 0)
- Helicopter is 30% of current value
- Car is 10% of the condition 5 value minus $500 per thousand miles but the
value can no more than $2000 and no less than 0


The scrapValue (getScrapValue()) should be reflected in the toString, if they’re
scrapped and the regular value should be reflected if they’re active. The toString
should also reflect their type. 

You also need to create a Highway class which does
the following:
- Creates 4 Vehicles: 1, Vehicle 1 Car, 1 Truck and 1 Helicopter. Stored in an
array, respectively.
- The Helicopter have their maxWeight increased by 10K
- The Car is towed
- The Vehicle is “rebuilt” as a Helicopter. (hint create a static method
“rebuild” in the Car class that will output a Helicopter from a Vehicle with a
maxWeight of 100K)
- The original Helicopter is scrapped
- The Car is demolished and converted to a golf cart(hint create a static
method salvage Car class)
- The Truck tows all the Vehicles in a loop (Not one by one)
Make sure to communicate each action along with any severance information.
As much code as possible needs to be reused! The super keyword should be
used as much as possible. The static variables can only be edited in the class
itself and not the Highway. So only getters for the static methods.
