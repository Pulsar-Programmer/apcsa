The goal of this lab is to solve a rectangular maze which will be loaded
in from a separate text file. The text file will contain a rectangle of
horizontal of vertical “pipes” represented by the ‘-‘ and ‘|’ characters
and ‘x’ characters representing impassable zones. There is also a pair of
other characters which you need to try to chart a path between. The
output will be the solved maze, but if there’s no solution then print
saying that.
The maze needs to be solved recursively by checking the adjacent
squares for empty spots and recursively calling the method from that
possible path.
Make sure to test mazes, that you create yourself and not just the
single one provided.
Ensure the program doesn’t crash for “trivial” or empty mazes and
mazes that don’t have solutions.

Call your classes Pipes and PipesDriver make sure that it has a
constructor which will take in a file and builds a 2D board out of that.
Get the name of the file from the user. Create a driver called
PipesDriver
The only class variables you should need is a 2D array of chars and the
start and end spots represented as Point variables.
